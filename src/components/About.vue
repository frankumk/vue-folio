            <h2>I like to build things.</h2>
            <p>I am a web developer. I have a diverse background in engineering and teaching.
              Currently I work as a project manager for an IT team that
              supports HRIS software solutions. I like living where
              technology meets teaching, where the two join to solve real
              human dilemmas. I like learning how things work. I am a bootcamp
              grad, looking to move into a more technical role. I want to build meaningful
               tools that improve the user experience.</p>
